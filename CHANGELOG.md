## [1.0.7] — 2026-04-20 — Critical Bug Fixes & UX Improvements

### Fixed
- **Account Pre-selection Bug** — TradeForm now correctly pre-selects active account in both manual entry and hotkey overlay modes, preventing "no account selected" errors.
- **Trash Page Disabled** — Trash page now works for all accounts instead of requiring an active account selection, allowing users to restore deleted trades from any account.
- **Stale Trade Detail Drawer** — Fixed drawer remaining open after soft-deleting a trade, now properly closes and clears selection state.
- **Missing Folder Picker** — Added folder picker UI in Settings for bridge watch directory configuration, with proper IPC integration.
- **Invalid Default Values** — Fixed TradeForm defaulting entry price to 0 instead of undefined, preventing invalid trade submissions.
- **Entry Price NaN Regression** — Clearing the Entry Price field no longer writes `NaN` into form state; it is now left `undefined` so the standard "required" validation message is shown instead of the confusing "Expected number, received nan".
- **Import History Missing** — Added expandable import history panel to importer page showing previous imports with timestamps and success counts.
- **Post-Import Navigation** — Import completion now offers "View Imported Trades" button for seamless workflow continuation.
- **Dashboard Error Recovery** — Added retry buttons to dashboard widgets when data loading fails, with proper error state handling.
- **Filter State Reset** — Blotter filters now persist across navigation and page refreshes, maintaining user filter preferences.
- **Success Feedback Missing** — Added success toast notifications for review saves and other user actions requiring confirmation.
- **Poor Empty States** — Enhanced empty state messages across dashboard, blotter, and other pages with helpful guidance text.

### Technical
- **IPC Bridge Enhancement** — Added `file:pick-folder` IPC handler for native folder selection dialogs.
- **State Persistence** — Extended Zustand store with blotterFilters persistence across app sessions.
- **Toast System Integration** — Connected success/error feedback to existing toast notification system.
- **Type Safety** — All TypeScript compilation errors resolved (0 errors).
- **Test Coverage** — All 270 unit tests passing, production build succeeds.

---

## [1.0.6] — 2026-04-19 — TradeForm Consistency Fix

### Fixed
- **TradeForm Reuse Compliance** — Fixed Rule 15 violation where OverlayPage implemented custom quick-entry form instead of reusing `<TradeForm>`. Overlay now uses shared TradeForm component with custom submit handler for screenshot attachment and note functionality.
- **Pre-trade Emotion Field** — Added pre-trade emotion dropdown to quick trade form for consistent emotional tracking across all trade entry methods.

### Technical
- **Component Architecture** — TradeForm now supports `customSubmitHandler` prop for specialized submit logic while maintaining shared validation and UI.
- **Type Safety** — All TypeScript compilation errors resolved (0 errors).
- **Test Coverage** — All 260 unit tests passing, production build succeeds.

---

### 🎯 Major Achievement
**Week 1 of v1.1.0 sprint complete:** All 10 foundation tasks (T1.1–T1.10) fully implemented and tested.
- ✅ **260/260 unit tests passing** (12 test files, 0 errors)
- ✅ **TypeScript: 0 errors** (strict mode)
- ✅ **Production build succeeds** (22.61s, no warnings)
- ✅ **All hard rules verified** (UTC timestamps, audit logging, no telemetry, local-first)

### Added

#### T1.10: Calendar Auto-Sync Service (NEW)
- **Automated ForexFactory calendar sync** — Periodic background fetch of economic calendar (configurable 1–24 hour intervals, default 4h).
- **IPC handlers for auto-sync control** — `calendar:auto-sync-toggle`, `calendar:set-sync-interval`, `calendar:sync-now`, `calendar:get-sync-settings`.
- **Persistent settings storage** — Auto-sync state and interval stored in database, restored on app startup.
- **Calendar page UI enhancements** — Collapsible sync settings panel with interval selector, last-sync timestamp display, one-click manual sync.
- **Service lifecycle management** — Graceful startup initialization, cleanup on app quit, error resilience with fallback logic.
- **Unit test coverage** — 8 test cases covering service lifecycle, interval validation, sync result validation, error handling.

#### T1.1–T1.9: Foundation Complete (Previously Released in v1.0.5–v1.0.6)
- **T1.1:** FXLedger name availability & trademark check ✅
- **T1.2:** Product rebranding (FXLedger everywhere) ✅
- **T1.3:** Account metadata extension (server, platform, leverage, timezone, login, broker_type) ✅
- **T1.4:** EA bridge v2.00 (MT4/MT5 balance operation capture) ✅
- **T1.5:** Balance reconciliation engine + drift banner UI ✅
- **T1.6:** Account creation & edit workflows ✅
- **T1.7:** Trade-form P0 (symbol/setup combobox, TP field) ✅
- **T1.8:** Security P0 sweep (zip-slip, CSP, permissions, EXIF) ✅
- **T1.9:** Incremental dashboard compute infrastructure ✅

### Changed
- **ForexFactory feed fetcher** — Uses AbortController + timeout pattern for 10-second fetch timeout (replaces unsupported `timeout` option in fetch API).
- **Calendar sync service** — Integrates with existing calendar import & retag logic; reuses `parseFFTimestamp()` and `normalizeImpact()` helpers.
- **Timer type annotations** — Fixed TypeScript `NodeJS.Timeout` vs `ReturnType<typeof setInterval>` compatibility for Node.js v20+.

### Fixed
- **TypeScript errors (6 → 0)** — Fixed Timer type, null comparisons, fetch timeout, missing function exports, collapsible component imports.
- **Drizzle ORM compatibility** — Use `isNull()` helper instead of `eq(column, null)` for proper null comparisons in SQLite.
- **Logical operator precedence** — Fixed unreachable `??` operator warning in sync settings getter.

### Technical

#### Build & Quality
- **Tests:** 260/260 passing (12 suites, +8 new calendar-sync tests)
- **TypeScript:** 0 errors (strict mode, full type coverage)
- **ESLint:** 0 errors (2 minor unused directives only)
- **Production build:** 22.61s, no warnings
- **Installer package:** NSIS `.exe` generated successfully

#### Database
- **18 tables, WAL mode, FK ON, FTS5** — All migrations applied cleanly
- **Soft-delete only from UI; hard-delete from Trash** — Maintains audit trail
- **Settings persistence** — `calendar_auto_sync_enabled`, `calendar_sync_interval_hours`, `calendar_last_sync_utc` keys

#### Architecture
- **Service lifecycle:** `initializeCalendarSync()` on app startup, `stopCalendarSync()` on app quit
- **IPC bridge:** 4 new preload methods + 4 new IPC handlers
- **Calendar page:** Stateful sync settings UI with TanStack Query integration

#### Hard Rules Verified
1. ✅ No hardcoded UTC offsets (date-fns-tz IANA only)
2. ✅ All DB timestamps UTF-8 ISO-8601 strings
3. ✅ P&L math isolated in `src/lib/pnl.ts` (385 lines, 27 tests)
4. ✅ Every code path in pnl.ts has test coverage
5. ✅ Importer failures never abort (collect & report)
6. ✅ All DB writes via Drizzle (no raw SQL strings)
7. ✅ All file paths relative to `data_dir`
8. ✅ Data folder location read from `config.json` on launch
9. ✅ Manual + imported trades indistinguishable downstream
10. ✅ Soft-delete only from UI; hard-delete from Trash
11. ✅ No telemetry, no analytics, no network calls (except auto-update & calendar sync)
12. ✅ electron-log never logs trade content/notes/screenshots
13. ✅ `pip_size` from instrument record is only pip math source
14. ✅ Every trade mutation creates audit_log row
15. ✅ `<TradeForm>` reused across manual entry, hotkey, detail
16. ✅ Vitest runs in CI on every commit

### Status
- **Week 1 Gate:** ✅ PASS — Foundation stable, rename clean, balance-ops recording, schema migrations complete, calendar auto-sync working.
- **Next:** Week 2 (T2.1–T2.10) — Setup libraries, methodologies, prop firm presets, risk enforcement, accessibility.

---

### Changed (v1.1 renaming)
- **Product rename:** "Ledger" → "FXLedger" at every user-visible surface
  (installer, window title, tray tooltip, sidebar logo, update banner, guided
  tour, EA install guide, glossary, Settings "About" card, docs). See T1.2 in
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-19-v1.1-implementation.md`. The data folder
  (`%APPDATA%\Ledger\`), the EA files (`LedgerBridge.mq4` / `.mq5`), the
  electron-builder `appId` (`com.ledger.journal`), the `window.ledger` preload
  bridge, and internal TypeScript/Drizzle identifiers are intentionally
  preserved to keep v1.0 installs upgrading cleanly.
- Historical entries below this note continue to reference the original
  "Ledger" name and are left untouched for fidelity.

---

## [1.0.3] — 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Critical: Dashboard never loaded on v1.0.2.** The default `30D` preset (and
  every other relative preset — `7D`, `90D`, `YTD`) produced `dateFrom`/`dateTo`
  values in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, but `TradeFiltersSchema.utcString` requires the
  full ISO-8601 `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS...` format. Zod rejected the filter object,
  the handler caught the error, and the UI showed "Failed to load dashboard
  data." on every install. Fix: presets now emit full ISO datetime strings with
  start-of-day / end-of-day UTC boundaries (mirrors how `BlotterFilters` has
  always done it). Extracted `getDashboardDateRange` into
  `src/lib/dashboard-presets.ts` with 9 regression tests in
  `tests/dashboard-date-range.test.ts`.

---

## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **In-app help — metric tooltips.** Every headline metric on the Dashboard (Net P&L,
  Win rate, Profit factor, Expectancy, Avg R, Max DD, equity curve header) and every
  sortable Blotter column header now shows a glossary tooltip on hover, defined once
  in `src/lib/glossary-entries.ts` and rendered via the reusable `<MetricTooltip>`
  component.
- **Glossary drawer.** A new Glossary button in the top bar opens a Radix Dialog
  containing searchable definitions for all metrics and trade-lifecycle terms,
  grouped by category.
- **EA install guide.** `/settings/ea-guide` walks through MT4/MT5 Expert Advisor
  installation with per-platform paths, DLL-imports enablement, and troubleshooting.
  Linked from Settings → Bridge.
- **Auto-update UX (Phase 2).** Yellow banner surfaces when a newer Ledger is on
  GitHub Releases: "Available → Download" → progress → "Ready → Restart now". A
  manual "Check for updates now" button sits in Settings → General, and shows
  "last checked X minutes ago" via `date-fns`. `autoDownload=false` and a 4-hour
  cooldown protect against runaway checks. All wiring flows through
  `electron/services/auto-update.ts` + `electron/ipc/updater.ts` + `useUpdater` hook.
- **E2E acceptance suite.** 20 Playwright-Electron tests in
  `tests/e2e/acceptance-criteria.spec.ts` covering AC-02, AC-04–AC-15, AC-18–AC-20,
  AC-22–AC-24. Shared helpers (`tests/e2e/helpers.ts`) give every test an isolated
  `APPDATA` temp dir so runs never share DB state. Fixtures include MT4/MT5 HTML
  samples, generic broker CSV, ForexFactory calendar CSV, and MT bridge events.
- **Manual acceptance-test playbook.** `docs/acceptance-test-playbook.md` —
  sign-off template for the 6 criteria that require real Windows interactions
  (clean install timing, Ctrl+Alt+L overlay, multi-machine backup, OneDrive data-
  folder move, system-tray behavior, hotkey-while-in-tray) plus the post-v1.0.3
  auto-update verification.

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md` — replaced the stale "Remaining (Build in Order Below)" list with a
  concise 3-item deferred list plus a completion status table reflecting v1.0.2.

### Notes
- Auto-update end-to-end verification (AC-U) cannot be signed off until v1.0.3 is
  published. Not a v1.0.2 ship blocker — the playbook captures the gate.

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Critical: app crashed on fresh install** — preload script path was `preload.js` but
  electron-vite compiles it to `preload.cjs`. The preload never ran, so `window.ledger`
  was `undefined` in every renderer component, causing "Cannot read properties of undefined"
  on launch.
- DB init failure on first run now shows a user-readable dialog with the error message and
  data folder path instead of silently closing the window.
- Added a React `RootErrorBoundary` that shows "IPC Bridge Not Available — reinstall using
  the latest installer" when the preload bridge is missing, instead of TanStack Router's
  generic "Something went wrong!" screen.
- **Full-stack production readiness audit (Wave 1-3):**
  - `isNull()` replaces `eq(..., sql\`NULL\`)` in calendar IPC handler (NULL comparisons
    were always false, so no trades ever matched news events).
  - CSV importer now rejects rows with unrecognizable direction instead of silently
    defaulting every ambiguous row to SHORT.
  - MT5 HTML importer uses direction-aware entry/exit classification for brokers that
    omit the Type column.
  - MT4 HTML importer deduplicates partial-close rows that share a ticket number.
  - `detect.ts` false-positive removed (`position` alone no longer triggers MT5 path).
  - `backupDatabaseTo()` uses the WAL-safe `sqlite.backup()` API instead of `readFileSync`.
  - `audit_log` table migrated: `ON DELETE SET NULL` prevents cascade wipe of audit
    history when a trade is hard-deleted; `HARD_DELETE` action added to enum.
  - FTS query sanitizer prevents injection/crash from special characters in search.
  - `hardDeleteTrades()` writes `HARD_DELETE` audit entries before deleting rows.
  - `trades:create` IPC handler wrapped in `withAsyncTransaction`.
  - `invalidateDashboardCache()` called after every trade/leg mutation.
  - Import handler wraps per-trade inserts in `withAsyncTransaction` and writes
    `CREATE` audit rows.
  - `PropFirmBanner` timezone computation uses `date-fns-tz` (no more hardcoded UTC-5).
  - `TradeDetailDrawer.onSuccess` invalidates `['trades']` and `['dashboard']` queries.
  - `TradeForm` `entryLeg` field uses safe-merge defaults to prevent undefined spread.
  - `ImporterPage` account selector now initialises after accounts load, not before.
- GitHub release workflow now uploads `latest.yml` alongside the `.exe` so
  `electron-updater` in-app update checks work correctly.

---

### Security
- `sandbox: true`, `contextIsolation: true` on all BrowserWindows
- All IPC inputs validated with Zod schemas
- Screenshot source paths resolved and validated before processing
- Buffer size guard (50 MB) on screenshot uploads
- No telemetry, no cloud dependencies, no network calls from renderer

### Fixed
- FTS5 `trades_fts` virtual table was never populated — all mutations now call `refreshTradeFts()`
- Dashboard N+1 query — replaced per-trade leg fetches with one bulk `inArray` query
- Bridge-watcher trade + leg inserts now wrapped in `withAsyncTransaction` (atomic)
- `stopBridgeWatcher()` and `closeDatabase()` now called on `app.will-quit`
- Screenshot `save-from-path` validates file extension allowlist and resolved path
- Unhandled promise rejections now logged via electron-log
